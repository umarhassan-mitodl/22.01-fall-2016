**Description:** Prof. Short goes to Russia, and Ka-Yen (one of the teaching assistants) explains in detail how nuclear reactors work. Concepts from the course thus far are blended with previews of future courses to physically explain how current and future nuclear reactors produce heat and energy. Aspects of safety are discussed between different designs, and the details of major reactor accidents are explained.

**Instructor:** Ka-Yen Yau
