**Description:** Today we formally introduce the concept that mass is energy, by exploring trends in nuclear stability. We introduce the notation weâ€™ll use to describe nuclei and their reactions throughout the rest of the course, and introduce nuclear binding energy, analogous to chemical binding energy. We also introduce cross sections, or per-particle nuclear reaction probabilities, showing how a simple, first-order differential equation can result in their definition.
